# Project 2 - Full-Stack MERN

![MERN](https://geeksperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mern-img.png")

## Task

Your task is to build a full-stack (Mongoose/Express/React/Node), professional-looking application with a functioning backend and frontend. Your website should allow users to interact with its pages, make _requests_ (buttons, HTML forms, dropdowns, searchbars, etc.) to your backend, and *display the data* (text, images, etc.) in a meaningful way. Try to think about building an application that will create an engaging user experience.

## For Project Approval

- Detailed README (Name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Component Hierarchy Diagram (Lucidchart or other) for the frontend
- A **public** Trello board for tracking your development progress

**Project _Approval_ Due Date:** 8/30/21 by 10:00am EST

## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**

- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your github and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 2, give it a real name.
- Have a separate directory for the frontend (client) and have your backend within the main repository.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Your README should have your name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of 2 Mongoose Schemas (models)
- Have (POST, GET, DELETE) operations
- Display data from each model on the frontend (unless given an exemption on one by an Instructor)
- Must be able to navigate between different pages (React Router)
- Have at least **40 _meaningful_ `git` commits**. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

**Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 9/3/21 by 2:30pm EST

## Tips

- Chat and bounce ideas off your classmates and gather useful feedback
- Commit early (day one) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement all project requirements _before_ moving on to post-mvp features
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)

## Post-MVP Ideas

- Integrate UPDATE (PUT)
- Integrate a 3rd party API (Ask us for a list)
- Integrate a UI Library ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [React-MD](https://react-md.dev/v1/), [React Rainbow](https://react-rainbow.io/))

## A Note on Plagiarism
  
- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is ***not acceptable to copy*** another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to ***ask your instructor***. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
